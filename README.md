# Heart_of_Darkness_RG-350

Based on the original source code by Gregory Montoir (http://cyxdown.free.fr/hode/)

To compile the program just type "make -f Makefile.rg350".

After compiling the program copy the following files to the build directory:
- hod.paf (hod_demo.paf, hod_demo2.paf)
- setup.dat,
- *_hod.lvl,
- *_hod.sss,
- *_hod.mst,

and run the script make_opk.sh to generate the opk file for the RG350.
